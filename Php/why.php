                    <h1>What is nutrition?</h1>
                    <p class='square'>As molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics advance, nutrition has become more focused on metabolism and metabolic pathways - biochemical steps through which substances inside us are transformed from one form to another.</p>                    
                    <p class='square'>Nutrition also focuses on how diseases, conditions, and problems can be prevented or reduced with a healthy diet.</p>
                    <p class='square'>Similarly, nutrition involves identifying how certain diseases and conditions may be caused by dietary factors, such as poor diet (malnutrition), food allergies, and food intolerances.</p>

                    <h1>What is the difference between a dietitian and a nutritionist?</h1>
                    <p>A registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN) studies food, nutrition, and dietetics through an accredited university and approved curriculum, then completes a rigorous internship and passes a licensure exam to become a registered dietitian.</p>
                    <p>A nutritionist (without the title of an RD or RDN) studies nutrition via self-study or through formal education but does not meet the requirements to use the titles RD or RDN. The two terms are often interchangeable, but they are not identical.</p>

                    <h2>Dietetics</h2>
                    <p>Dietetics is the interpretation and communication of the science of nutrition; it helps people make informed and practical choices about food and lifestyle in both health and disease.</p>
                    <p>Part of a dietician's course includes both hospital and community settings. Dietitians work in a variety of areas, from private practice to healthcare, education, corporate wellness, and research, while a much smaller proportion work in the food industry.</p>
                    <p>A dietitian must have a recognized degree or postgraduate degree in nutrition and dietetics and meet continuing education requirements to work as a dietitian.</p>

                    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
                    <p class='square'>Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses nutrients, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease.</p>
                    <p class='square'>Major food manufacturers employ nutritionists and food scientists.</p>
                    <p class='square'>Nutritionists may also work in journalism, education, and research. Many nutritionists work in the field of food science and technology.</p>
                    <p class='square'>There is a lot of overlap between what nutritionists and dietitians do and study. Some nutritionists work in a healthcare setting, some dietitians work in the food industry, but a higher percentage of nutritionists work in the food industry and in food science and technology, and a higher percentage of dietitians work in healthcare, corporate wellness, research, and education.</p>

                    <h1>The human body requires seven major types of nutrients</h1>
                    <p>A nutrient is a source of nourishment, a component of food, for instance, protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin, mineral, fiber, and water.</p>
                    <p>Macronutrients are nutrients we need in relatively large quantities.</p>
                    <p>Micronutrients are nutrients we need in relatively small quantities.</p>
                    <p>Macronutrients can be further split into energy macronutrients (that provide energy), and macronutrients that do not provide energy.</p>
